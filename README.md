# README

What is this?

* This is a work-in-progress.

* This is Hylyle, a personal assistant. At least, that what I call it - it is essentially a schedule-keeping application. It's also a small thing I made in my free time to keep myself busy when I've got nothing else to do.

Well, what can it do?

* Right now? You can create an account and then create events.

Why does it look so ... bare?

* Right now, it only uses rails + html, with a little bit of css. Eventually, I plan to use bootstrap, but I would like to first create functionality before I redo the look of the site.

What functionalities do you plan to add?

* Like it says on the home page, after I get events fully working, I want to add the ability to create activities, and when that gets fully fleshed out, I'll look into improving interactiveness.
